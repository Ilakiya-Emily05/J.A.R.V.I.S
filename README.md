JarvisAI is an advanced, CUDA-accelerated AI assistant being developed with deep learning integration for real-time voice command processing and smart task execution.

Unlike traditional rule-based assistants, JarvisAI aims to understand context, emotion, and intent through custom-trained NLP and speech recognition models.
This project is a step toward building production-grade AI systems, optimized for GPU performance and scalable inference.
